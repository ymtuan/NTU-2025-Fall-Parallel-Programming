          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 4.3 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 1.00 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.23 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons    
          on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 2.3 cycles being stalled waiting on a fixed latency execution   
          dependency. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in         
          already highly optimized kernels. Try to hide the corresponding instruction latencies by increasing the       
          number of active warps, restructuring the code or unrolling loops. Furthermore, consider switching to         
          lower-latency instructions, e.g. by making use of fast math compiler options. This stall type represents      
          about 53.9% of the total average of 4.3 cycles between issuing two instructions.                              
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on         
          sampling data. The Kernel Profiling Guide

          on each stall reason.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 6.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced   
          to 5.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.       
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
