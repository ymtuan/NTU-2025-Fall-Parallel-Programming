    OPT   This workload exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak           
          performance of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak           
          typically indicate latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential       
          reasons.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this workload each scheduler only    
          issues an instruction every 1.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this workload allocates an average    
          of 8.25 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.21 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible       
          warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no      
          eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the       
          number of eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per      
          warp. Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 8.5 cycles being stalled waiting to be selected to fetch an     
          instruction or waiting on an instruction cache miss. A high number of warps not having an instruction         
          fetched is typical for very short kernels with less than one full wave of work in the grid. Excessively       
          jumping across large blocks of assembly code can also lead to more warps stalled for this reason, if this     
          causes misses in the instruction cache. See also the related Branch Resolving state. This stall type          
          represents about 57.9% of the total average of 14.7 cycles between issuing two instructions.

    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 24.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 22.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
