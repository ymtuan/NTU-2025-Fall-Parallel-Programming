    OPT   Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory: Look at the Compute Workload Analysis section to see what the   
          compute pipelines are spending their time doing. Also, consider whether any computation is redundant and      
          could be reduced or moved to look-up tables.

          On average, each warp of this workload spends 6.5 cycles being stalled waiting to be selected to fetch an     
          instruction or waiting on an instruction cache miss. A high number of warps not having an instruction         
          fetched is typical for very short kernels with less than one full wave of work in the grid. Excessively       
          jumping across large blocks of assembly code can also lead to more warps stalled for this reason, if this     
          causes misses in the instruction cache. See also the related Branch Resolving state. This stall type          
          represents about 49.5% of the total average of 13.2 cycles between issuing two instructions.

    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on         
          sampling data. The Kernel Profiling Guide

          on each stall reason.

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This workload achieves an average of 24.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced  
          to 22.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.
